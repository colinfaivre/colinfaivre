I am passionate about building web apps and learning.

I discovered web development when I had to create my music bands websites, I remember being deeply impressed by how learning to code is empowering and fun. Over the course of my career, I have been fortunate to work with various companies with a strong focus on user experience and writing maintainable code. I love building web games to consolidate my fullstack learnings.

I am also a MOOC addict, I dedicate a significant part of my free time on learning at FrontendMasters and Coursera and mentoring at OpenClassrooms. Helping students and colleagues boosting their web development skills fills me with joy and helps reinforce my basics.
