I am passionate about building web apps and learning.

I discovered web development when I had to create my music bands websites, I remember being deeply impressed by how learning to code is empowering and fun. Over the course of my carreer, I have been fortunate to work with various companies with a strong focus on user experience and writing maintainable code.

I am also a MOOC addict, I dedicate a big part of my free time on learning on Frontend Masters and Coursera and teaching at OpenClassrooms. Helping students going from zero to hero in web development fills me with joy and helps me gain confidence as I am constantly back to the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.
